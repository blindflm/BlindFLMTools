Blind FLM Web-Based Tools
=========

A calculator and editor were developed to predict the execution time of users who are blind when interacting with smartphones. The structure of the website utilised a simple multi-level menu from [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/?p=25521). The editor also uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) to allow for peduo-code modelling.
